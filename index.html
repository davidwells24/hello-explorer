      <p>
        The Earth is a large, round object in space that is home to all known life. It is made up of land, water, and air, with different environments like forests, oceans, mountains, and deserts. The Earth orbits the Sun, which provides warmth and light, and has a protective atmosphere that keeps it livable. People, animals, and plants live on the Earth, and it spins around its axis, creating day and night. It is one of several planets in a vast space called the universe.
