      <!-- Model: ChatGPT-4 | Prompt: Write a short description about the Moon for an astrophysicist in the most scientific way possible. Add-on: Make the response even more scientific that even the smartest person would have trouble understanding it. -->
      <p>
        The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has a diameter of 3,474 km and orbits at a semi-major axis of 384,400 km. Its surface features regolith, with highlands composed of anorthosite and maria formed by basaltic lava. The Moon is tidally locked, with a sidereal rotation and orbital period of about 27.3 days. Its gravitational interactions with Earth influence tidal forces and angular momentum exchange. The dominant formation theory is the giant impact hypothesis, where a collision with a proto-planet resulted in a synestia that coalesced into the Moon. The Moon lacks a significant exosphere or magnetic field.
